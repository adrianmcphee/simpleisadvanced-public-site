  <p class="part">The Fix</p>
  <h1>Chapter 16: The First Unit</h1>

  <p>The model described in this book does not require wholesale restructuring. It does not require the CEO to dismantle the organisation chart, the CTO to rewrite the architecture, or the board to approve a three-year transformation programme before anything changes. It requires one unit, operating with clarity, governed by a charter that makes autonomy real from day one.</p>
<p>This is not a pilot. A pilot is a temporary experiment, provisionally funded, structurally dependent on the old model for its authority, and designed to be evaluated by the people whose power it threatens. Pilots fail not because the model is wrong but because the organisational immune system has been given an explicit mechanism for rejection: the evaluation gate. The first autonomous unit is a permanent structural change. It operates under its own governance charter, with real authority over its process, its data, its releases, and its priorities. It is evaluated by its outcomes, not by a committee.</p>
<p>One unit, operating with genuine autonomy, creates the selection pressure described earlier in this book. It makes the cost of the surrounding dysfunction visible by contrast. When a single process runs faster, resolves issues in hours rather than weeks, and produces measurable outcomes without coordination theatre, the adjacent teams do not need a strategy deck to understand what has changed. They can see it. The question shifts from “should we restructure?” to “why does everything else still work the old way?”</p>
<p>The choice of which process to give to the first autonomous unit is consequential, and the temptation is to overthink it. Organisations that spend six months selecting the perfect candidate have already failed, because the selection process itself becomes a coordination exercise governed by the old model. The criteria are pragmatic, and they interact: no process will satisfy all of them perfectly. The goal is to find one that satisfies them well enough to succeed, not one that eliminates all risk.</p>
