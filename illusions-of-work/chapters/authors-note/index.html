  <h1>Author&#x27;s Note</h1>

  <p>I have spent more than twenty years inside software-dependent corporates in roles ranging from engineer to CTO. I served as CTO of a leading ecommerce marketplace with more than 13 million customers, led a technology organisation of over a thousand people as CTO of an ECB-regulated multinational with €10 billion turnover, and transformed how hundreds of engineers work at a unicorn fintech. I have redirected hundreds of millions in product and technology investment and written off programmes that should never have been funded.</p>
<p>Throughout those years, I watched talented people lose to structures that rewarded ambiguity over precision. Engineers who understood the real system were told they lacked soft skills. Architects who presented honest assessments were told they needed to be more strategic. The people who could describe what was actually happening were systematically sidelined in favour of those who could describe what the organisation wanted to hear. The dysfunction was visible to everyone who worked close to reality. It was simply too expensive to confront.</p>
<p>For the past few years I have been using AI daily: building a sophisticated platform from scratch for Eccasion with serial founders of a European mobility company, leading a large-scale SDLC overhaul to make a unicorn AI-ready, and developing TuinPlan, an AI-native digital twin for garden planning. What I noticed across all of this work was that the real value of AI was not generation. It was synthesis: reconciling what people said they would build with what was actually there. I kept business plans, user journeys, and process descriptions in structured, machine-readable formats. I could point an AI at those artefacts alongside the codebase and ask where intent and reality had diverged. The AI could answer because the inputs were explicit enough to parse. Vagueness did not produce flexibility. It produced hallucination.</p>
