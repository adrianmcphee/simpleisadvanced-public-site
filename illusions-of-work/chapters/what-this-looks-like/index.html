  <h1>Chapter 19: What This Looks Like</h1>

  <p>This chapter describes a year in the life of an organisation that has made the transition. Not a utopia. A realistic picture, with remaining tensions, trade-offs, and difficulties acknowledged. The point is not to promise perfection. It is to show that the problems change in kind, and that the new problems are the kind that capable people can solve.</p>
<p>I have seen versions of this transition. The details are composited and fictionalised, as throughout the book, but the pattern, the initial resistance, the contract that replaced coordination, the incident resolved in minutes rather than days, is drawn from real organisations I have worked inside. Not every transition succeeded fully. Some stalled when political will ran out. Some produced partial results that were still better than the status quo. What follows is not aspiration. It is what happens when the commitment holds.</p>
<p>The transition did not begin with a reorganisation. It began with a single unit. The payments team, seven people at the time, was the first to operate under a governance charter. It was chosen because its process had clear boundaries, measurable outcomes, and a lead who had spent years holding the contradictions between what the organisation said its payments process did and what it actually did. The payments unit&#x27;s results over its first six months, resolution times measured in hours rather than weeks, cost per transaction down by a fifth, contract violations detected and resolved without escalation, created the political conditions for the other eleven units to follow. By the time the broader restructuring was announced, the payments unit had already answered the question that every sceptic was asking.</p>
