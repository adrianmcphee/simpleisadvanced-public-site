  <h1>Chapter 2: Why People Closest to Reality Suffer</h1>

  <p>Why People Closest to Reality Suffer It does not happen in a crisis or a confrontation. It is quieter than that.</p>
<p>A principal engineer at an online fashion marketplace raises a concern about a dependency that will block the roadmap. The concern is noted but not addressed. She flags a risk in an architecture review. The risk is acknowledged but deprioritised. She points out that a commitment made to the board cannot be delivered as described. She is told to “find a way.” She suggests an alternative approach that would achieve the goal more reliably. The suggestion is described as “too technical” for the current discussion.</p>
<p>After enough of these exchanges, she stops. Not because she has lost the knowledge. She still sees the problems clearly, still traces the dependencies in her head, still knows which parts of the system are fragile and why. But the cost of stating what she sees has become higher than the cost of staying silent. She learns that the organisation does not want the information she has. It wants compliance wrapped in technical language.</p>
<p>An operations analyst at a logistics company maintains a spreadsheet that nobody asked her to create.</p>
