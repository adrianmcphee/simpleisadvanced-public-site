  <h1>Chapter 14: The Rate Has Changed</h1>

  <p>She was thirty-one when the rewrite started and thirty-four when it was quietly abandoned.</p>
<p>The platform was called Horizon. The name was chosen at a leadership offsite in Lisbon, printed on lanyards at the kick-off, and repeated in every steering committee for three years. The brief was unambiguous: replace the claims management system, a fifteen-year-old monolith written in a language that three people in the company still understood, with a modern, event-driven architecture that would “future-proof the business.”</p>
<p>Katrin joined as the second senior engineer on the programme. She had spent four years at the company, knew the legacy system better than anyone except the contractor who had left the previous autumn, and believed the rewrite was necessary. The monolith was genuinely painful. Deployments required a four-hour maintenance window. A schema change needed sign-off from two teams that no longer existed in the organisation chart, routed instead through a governance function that reviewed changes it could not evaluate. She had seen three incidents in a single quarter caused by the same race condition in the payment reconciliation path, each time patched differently because no one could hold the full system in their head long enough to fix it properly.</p>
<p>She believed the rewrite was necessary. She also watched it fail.</p>
