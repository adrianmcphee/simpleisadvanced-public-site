  <p class="part">Why Nothing Changes</p>
  <h1>Chapter 12: The Alignment-Industrial Complex</h1>

  <p>The delivery lead&#x27;s calendar shows forty-one hours of meetings this week. She has blocked two hours on Thursday morning for “focus time.” By Tuesday afternoon, a programme steering committee has been scheduled over it.</p>
<p>She does not build anything. She does not decide anything. She translates. She takes what the product manager says the business wants, what the architect says the system can support, and what the engineering teams say they can deliver, and she reconciles them into a plan that satisfies all three. The plan is presented weekly. It is revised weekly. It has never once survived contact with the sprint.</p>
<p>Her role exists because no one in the organisation can talk directly to anyone else. Product cannot talk to engineering because they do not share a vocabulary. Architecture cannot talk to delivery because their artefacts describe different systems. Engineering cannot talk to the business because the business does not attend their meetings. She is the connective tissue. She holds six relationships in her head simultaneously, translating each party&#x27;s reality into a language the others can accept.</p>
<p>She is very good at her job. She is also exhausted, because her job would not exist if the organisation were willing to put the people who decide and the people who build in the same room with shared accountability.</p>
