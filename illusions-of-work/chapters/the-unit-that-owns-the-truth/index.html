  <p class="part">The Fix</p>
  <h1>Chapter 15: The Unit That Owns the Truth</h1>

  <p>The payments unit has nine people. Two senior engineers, three engineers, a domain expert named Marta who spent twelve years in payments operations before joining the unit, a data analyst, a reliability engineer, and a unit lead who was previously a senior architect.</p>
<p>They own the payments process: premium collection, claims disbursement, broker commission payments, and refunds. They own the services that implement these flows, the data those services produce, and the contracts through which other units interact with them.</p>
<p>On a Wednesday morning, Marta notices that the refund process has a failure rate that has crept from 0.3% to 1.1% over the past month. She does not file a ticket with another team. She does not schedule a meeting with a product manager. Before approaching anyone, she checks the payment provider&#x27;s changelog herself. She finds that a response format change was shipped three weeks ago, and she suspects the refund service&#x27;s error handling has not been updated to match. She walks to the engineer who maintains the refund service and says: “Refund failures are climbing. The provider changed their response format on the fourteenth. I think our error handling is still expecting the old structure.”</p>
<p>The engineer checks the change history. Marta&#x27;s hypothesis is correct: the refund service&#x27;s error handling was not updated after the provider&#x27;s API change. The fix is twenty lines of code. He deploys it after lunch. Marta verifies the fix against the business rules she knows: refund amounts must match the original premium within tolerance, the customer notification must trigger within the correct window, and the reconciliation feed must include the corrected transactions. By Thursday, the failure rate is back to 0.3%.</p>
