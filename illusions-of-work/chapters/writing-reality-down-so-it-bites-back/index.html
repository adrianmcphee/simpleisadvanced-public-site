  <p class="part">What Was Never Written Down</p>
  <h1>Chapter 8: Writing Reality Down So It Bites Back</h1>

  <p>The new senior engineer spends her first week reading. The team lead has been thorough: a shared drive with architecture diagrams, a Confluence space with process descriptions, a wiki with onboarding guides. There is an operating model document, updated seven months ago, that describes the end-to-end vehicle configuration-to-delivery pipeline in careful detail.</p>
<p>By her third day she has questions. The operating model describes an automated validation step for customer configurations that checks battery options, drivetrain compatibility, and regional compliance before the order enters the manufacturing queue. The system she has been given access to does not contain this step. There is a comment in the code, dated two years ago, that says “validation bypassed pending new battery config rules.” The rules were never written. The automated validation exists in the documentation and in the quarterly metrics report, which lists configuration validation rates as a KPI. It does not exist in production.</p>
<p>She asks the team lead. He is not surprised. “That document describes what we were building towards,” he says. “The system describes what we actually did.” He opens a Slack channel and scrolls to a thread from eighteen months ago. “This is where the real decisions are. Most of them, anyway.”</p>
<p>She will spend the next two months learning what the system actually does, one incident at a time. By the time she understands it, she will also understand why nobody updated the documentation. Updating it would mean admitting how far the system has drifted from what was approved. That admission has a cost, and nobody has been willing to pay it. Most software-dependent corporates do not lack documentation. They lack documents that are allowed to be true.</p>
