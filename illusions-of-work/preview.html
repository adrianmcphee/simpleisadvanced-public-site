<h2><a href="./#authors-note">Author's Note</a></h2>
<p>I have spent more than twenty years inside software-dependent corporates in roles ranging from engineer to CTO. I served as CTO of a leading ecommerce marketplace with more than 13 million customers, led a technology organisation of over a thousand people as CTO of an ECB-regulated multinational with €10 billion turnover, and transformed how hundreds of engineers work at a unicorn fintech. I have redirected hundreds of millions in product and technology investment and written off programmes that should never have been funded.</p>
<p>Throughout those years, I watched talented people lose to structures that rewarded ambiguity over precision. Engineers who understood the real system were told they lacked soft skills. Architects who presented honest assessments were told they needed to be more strategic. The people who could describe what was actually happening were systematically sidelined in favour of those who could describe what the organisation wanted to hear. The dysfunction was visible to everyone who worked close to reality. It was simply too expensive to confront.</p>
<p>For the past few years I have been using AI daily: building a sophisticated platform from scratch for Eccasion (eccasion.com) with serial founders of a European mobility company, leading a large-scale SDLC overhaul to make a unicorn AI-ready, and developing TuinPlan (demandops.com), an AI-native digital twin for garden planning. What I noticed across all of this work was that the real value of AI was not generation. It was synthesis: reconciling what people said they would build with what was actually there. I kept business plans, user journeys, and process descriptions in structured, machine-readable formats. I could point an AI at those artefacts alongside the codebase and ask where intent and reality had diverged. The AI could answer because the inputs were explicit enough to parse. Vagueness did not produce flexibility; rather, it inevitably resulted in hallucination.</p>
<p>That discovery connected something. The dysfunction I had watched for twenty years is now colliding with a technology that inverts its economics entirely. The gap between narrative and reality, the exhaustion of the people who bridged it, the structures that made vagueness cheap and clarity expensive: all of it is meeting a technology that makes those conditions untenable, and faster than the people inside these organisations have grasped. The economy of vagueness is collapsing. AI bypasses narrative, seniority, and organisational ritual entirely, operating instead on explicit, parseable descriptions of how systems actually function. The conditions that make AI effective are exactly the conditions those same people have been asking for all along: explicit processes, real ownership, a straight line from business language into the code. Furthermore, those people, the ones closest to reality, the ones the organisation has been exhausting since the early 2010s, are precisely the ones it now needs most.</p>
<p>When I described this pattern publicly, the recognition was immediate and far broader than I expected.</p>
<p>So I wrote the book. It is blunt, sometimes uncomfortably so. This represents a structural rather than a stylistic choice. A book arguing that AI forces reconciliation between what you say and what is actually true cannot hedge, soften, or add diplomatic padding without becoming the thing it describes. The pathology is specific: organisations where software mediates value creation but governance has not adapted. Where ambiguity reflects genuine domain uncertainty rather than structural avoidance, the diagnosis does not apply.</p>
</section>
<section id="ch-1">
<h2><a href="./#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This book is for people who work inside software-dependent corporates and suspect that something is structurally wrong.</p>
<p>It is for CTOs, senior engineers, architects, product leaders, CEOs, board members, and investors who depend on the organisation being honest about how it works, and who have discovered that it is not. Each occupies a different position in the structure this book describes. What they share is the experience of watching technology investment produce activity without proportional outcomes, and the suspicion that the cause is not execution, talent, or technology, but something in the structure itself that no one has named.</p>
<p>If you have ever sat in a meeting where everyone agreed on a plan you knew could not work, and said nothing, because saying something would cost more than staying silent, this book is about why that happens, and what changes when it stops.</p>
<p>The examples in this book are fictional, but they are not hypothetical. Each is a composite drawn from patterns observed repeatedly across software-dependent corporates in banking, insurance, retail, logistics, and enterprise software. If they feel familiar, that is the point.</p>
<p>There is a particular kind of exhaustion that comes from working inside these organisations if you are close to how things actually work.</p>
<p>It is not simple tiredness, and it is not the kind of burnout people talk about. It is something quieter and more corrosive. The feeling of spending your days navigating abstractions that everyone treats as real, while knowing, very clearly, that they are not.</p>
<p>You sit in meetings where “the business” discusses priorities that have no stable relationship to the systems that produce value. You watch strategy documents grow longer as understanding shrinks. You see engineers blamed for outcomes that were decided elsewhere, in languages that cannot be executed. You notice that the more precisely you describe reality, the more friction you generate. This book is about why that happens.</p>
<p>It is not about bad people, bad intentions, or even incompetence. It is about a specific organisational form that has become widespread over the last two decades: the software-dependent corporate.</p>
<p>These are large, established organisations whose products and operations now depend critically on software, but whose power structures, budgeting models, and decision-making processes were designed for a world in which software was a support function: something you procured from vendors, managed through an IT department, and governed as a cost centre. Banks, insurers, retailers, logistics firms, airlines, public sector bodies, and also older companies that describe themselves as “technology companies” but still operate with these inherited assumptions all fall into this category.</p>
<p>These organisations are not “pre-software.” They have had software for decades. What they have not adapted to is the shift that began between roughly 2008 and 2012, when software stopped being infrastructure and became the primary medium through which these companies create and deliver value. In the space of five years, smartphones made software the default customer interface, cloud computing made custom development at scale economically viable, and the expectation that large organisations would build and operate their own software continuously went from radical to mainstream. By 2012, when the UK government adopted “Digital by Default,” the structural change was already complete: these organisations needed to become software companies. They hired engineers by the hundreds and adopted continuous delivery. But the governance structures, the budget cycles, the HR frameworks, and the executive mental models stayed where they were. The technology changed. The power structures did not. The misalignment has been compounding ever since.</p>
<p>These organisations will readily acknowledge that they have legacy software. They commission reports on technical debt, fund migration programmes, and talk openly about the need to modernise their technology estate. “Legacy” is an accepted category for systems: it implies something that was once fit for purpose but has been outgrown. But suggest that the governance structures are equally legacy, that the budgeting model, the HR framework, the separation of “the business” from engineering are design choices from a previous era, not laws of nature, and the conversation stops. The reason is simple: “legacy” implies something that needs to be replaced. Furthermore, the people who benefit from the current structures are the people who would need to authorise their replacement.</p>
<p>Branding does not matter here. What matters is whether software is the medium through which the organisation creates and delivers value, and whether the governance structures have caught up with that reality. In software-dependent corporates, the answer to the first question is yes and the answer to the second is no. Software mediates everything that matters: how customers are served, how products are built, how operations run. Yet it is still governed as a support function rather than as the system through which the business exists.</p>
<p>The most reliable diagnostic is linguistic. If your organisation talks about “the business” as a group of people who are not engineers, this book is about your company. If engineers are considered to work in the business by default, it probably is not.</p>
<p>Once that fundamental split exists, adhering to reality effectively becomes optional.</p>
<p>When reality is optional, the people closest to it suffer first.</p>
<p>Throughout this book, people closest to reality refers to those whose effectiveness depends on clear ownership, explicit constraints, and direct contact with real systems and customer outcomes. They are often engineers, but they also exist in product, design, data, and leadership roles. What they share is not seniority or status, but an inability to function well when ambiguity is rewarded and truth is negotiated. The claims handler who knows every process exception the system does not encode. The operations analyst whose shadow spreadsheet reconciles what the official reports cannot. The compliance officer who carries the real regulatory interpretation in her head because the documented version has not been updated in three years. These people are closest to reality not because of their job titles but because the work they do collapses without accurate information.</p>
<p>These people are not necessarily performing at a high level in such organisations. In fact, the system often prevents them from doing so. Their frustration is a structural consequence of working in an environment where representations of work are treated as substitutes for reality.</p>
<p>The illusions this book describes are not organisational stupidity. The narratives that replace reality, the fake products, the avoidant architectures, the processes never written down: none of these are failures of intelligence. They are coping mechanisms. They are how intelligent people remain functional inside a structure that will not let them do real work. The vagueness protects them. The fiction gives them something to point to. Every illusion serves someone’s need to remain sane inside a system that refuses to confront its own contradictions.</p>
<p>Since that shift, software-dependent corporates have survived this misalignment by making reality expensive and vagueness cheap. Understanding the system required meetings. Reconciling strategy required interpretation. Connecting cost to value required politics. The dysfunction was real, but it was survivable. Human synthesis could bridge the gap expensively, and market position provided insulation. Capable people suffered, but the organisation endured.</p>
<p>There is a test for how deep the misalignment runs. Until recently, it was too expensive to apply.</p>
<p>That is no longer true. Rather than introducing a novel problem, AI aggressively removes the insulation that allowed an old pathology to persist.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence rarely fixes broken organisations directly; instead, it does something far more disruptive. It changes the economics of clarity. In doing so, it turns more than a decade of survivable dysfunction into structural incompatibility. Organisations that cannot produce explicit, machine-readable descriptions of how they work cannot use AI for the thing that actually matters: continuous reconciliation of strategy, execution, and reality. They will be limited to copilots and content generation, useful, but incremental. Their competitors who can describe themselves clearly will have fundamentally different economics: faster decisions, cheaper adaptation, honest feedback loops. Far from closing, this capability gap will only continue to compound.</p>
<p>Here is what makes this urgent. The people who could make AI actually work, those who have the domain knowledge, who understand the real system, who know which parts of the architecture are fiction, are the same people the organisation has been exhausting since that shift began. They are the key to everything the organisation says it wants from artificial intelligence. They have the precision, the context, and the understanding of how the system actually behaves. Ultimately, they are burned out, disengaged, or gone. The organisation drove out precisely the people it now needs most.</p>
<p>AI rewards precision, explicitness, and versioned representations of reality. It cannot operate on narrative, implication, or organisational ritual. It does not care who said something, how senior they are, or how often it has been repeated. It only cares whether what is written can be read, reconciled, and reasoned about.</p>
<p>This means something specific. A clearly written strategy document is not enough. A well-maintained wiki is not enough. The descriptions of how the organisation works, its processes, its ownership boundaries, its contracts, its constraints, must be structured so that a machine can parse them, compare them against the codebase, and report contradictions without human interpretation. In this context, being machine-readable constitutes a hard structural requirement rather than merely a synonym for being well-written. Most organisations that believe they have documented their processes have not met this bar. They have produced artefacts that require a human to read, interpret, and bridge to reality. That bridging is exactly the expensive, fragile, political work that AI eliminates, but only when the inputs are machine-readable.</p>
<p>The same conditions that make AI useful are the conditions that make organisations humane and effective again. The antidote to the frustration experienced by people closest to reality is the same thing that feeds AI: explicit, machine-readable, versioned, owned descriptions of how the organisation actually works.</p>
<p>There is a simple test. If an AI system attempts to synthesise an organisation from its artefacts (strategy documents, process descriptions, architecture models, and codebases), will that synthesis converge on something coherent? Or will it collapse into contradiction and hallucination?</p>
<p>The answer depends on whether the organisation’s business processes, and the ownership, strategic goals, data models, system boundaries, and constraints that follow from them, exist as machine-readable, owned descriptions that can be parsed and reasoned about without human interpretation, or whether they exist as implicit knowledge carried in people’s heads and negotiated in meetings.</p>
<p>This is the spine of the book. The first half is a diagnosis, and it is not comfortable. If you have been punished for precision, exhausted by coordination, or silenced because your understanding of the system was unwelcome, you will recognise the patterns described. The second half describes a structure where those experiences stop. Not because the organisation becomes kinder, but because the economics no longer permit the alternative.</p>
<p>What follows is not a call for better communication, more alignment, or another round of transformation. It is an examination of why software-dependent corporates reliably produce illusions of work, how those illusions turn into activity without progress, and why a different organisational structure is now both possible and necessary.</p>
<p>It also explains why the dysfunction persists. If the pathology were merely accidental, competition would have eliminated it. It has not, because an entire ecosystem of roles, frameworks, and vendors has evolved to sustain it. This book calls it the Alignment-Industrial Complex: a system that converts structural incoherence into billable work, ensuring the diagnosis is never “we are organised incorrectly” but always “we need better alignment.” Understanding why the illusion survives is as important as understanding what it costs.</p>
<p>The book is organised in eight parts, each containing two to four chapters. Parts I through IV (The Split, How People Cope, What the Machines See, What Was Never Written Down) are the diagnosis: how people cope with structural dysfunction and what it costs them. Parts V and VI (Now Go Faster, Why Nothing Changes) are the turn: what happens when AI arrives and the structures that sustain the dysfunction fight back. Parts VII and VIII (The Fix, What It Looks Like) describe what changes when the structure stops working against the people inside it.</p>
<p>You do not need to read the book in order. If you already recognise the diagnosis, if the first few chapters describe your organisation and you want to know what to do about it, start at Part V or go directly to Parts VII and VIII. If you are a CEO, board member, or investor who needs the structural argument without the full diagnostic, Parts V through VIII contain it. The structural corrections described in this book require executive mandate. Process ownership, contract enforcement, and budget envelopes cannot be implemented unilaterally by engineering. A companion book, Illusions in the Boardroom, develops the governance case for authorising these changes. This book is written primarily for operators. That one is written for boards. The earlier parts will still be there when you want to understand why the patterns are so persistent.</p>
<p>Since the price of pretending has fundamentally changed, reality is no longer optional.</p>

<h2 class="part">The Split</h2>
<section id="ch-2">
<h2><a href="./#when-the-business-isnt-the-business">Chapter 1: When “the Business” Isn't the Business</a></h2>
<p>The CEO of a mid-sized European insurer is eighteen months into her tenure. She has done what a competent CEO should do.</p>
<p>She hired a respected CTO from a digital-native company. She funded a three-year technology modernisation programme at € 40 million, more than the board wanted, less than the CTO asked for, a reasonable compromise. She approved a new organisational structure: product-aligned teams, a platform group, an architecture function, quarterly reviews tied to business outcomes. She attended the first two quarterly reviews personally, to signal commitment.</p>
<p>The strategy appears coherent, the CTO is capable, the funding is secured, and the board remains supportive.</p>
<p>Two years in, the results are mixed. Some metrics have improved: deployment frequency is up, a customer-facing app has launched, the recruitment brand is stronger. But the core measures she cares about have not moved: time to market for new products, operational cost per policy, customer retention. Two major initiatives have been quietly descoped. The CTO reports progress. The CFO reports cost. Neither report contradicts the other. Neither explains why the organisation feels no different.</p>
<p>She asks her direct reports. Each gives a plausible account. The CTO says the legacy systems are harder to untangle than expected. The CFO says the technology spend is growing faster than the revenue it was meant to unlock. The COO says the teams are still learning to work in the new model. The HR director says engineering retention is a market-wide problem.</p>
<p>None of them is lying. None of them is wrong. Ultimately, none of them is describing the same organisation.</p>
<p>She commissions an external review. The consultants produce 120 slides. The diagnosis is familiar: alignment gaps, unclear ownership, siloed delivery. The recommendation is another reorganisation, a new operating model, a governance framework. She has seen this pattern before, at her previous company. She approved the same kind of review there. It produced the same kind of recommendations. She left before the results were visible.</p>
<p>She suspects the problem is not alignment, or talent, or even legacy technology. She suspects it is something in the structure itself, something that makes every reasonable decision produce unreasonable outcomes. But she cannot name it, because nothing in her reporting, her reviews, or her advisory relationships is designed to make it visible.</p>
<p>She approves the consultants’ recommendations because no concrete alternatives have been presented for consideration.</p>
<p>It is a failure of legibility. No business process in the organisation is defined explicitly enough to connect the strategy to the systems that must enact it. Each report is locally rational. None can be reconciled with the others, because no shared description of how the organisation actually works exists to reconcile them against.</p>
<p>For now, the gap is survivable. Humans perform the synthesis socially: through meetings, intermediaries, and the institutional knowledge of those who have been there longest. It is expensive, fragile, and entirely dependent on the continued presence and goodwill of the people doing the translating. Yet, despite its fragility, this social synthesis manages to keep the organisation functioning.</p>
<p>The quarterly business priorities meeting runs for ninety minutes. Fourteen people attend. A senior director presents the list: twelve items, each described in language that sounds decisive. “Accelerate digital onboarding.” “Improve cross-sell conversion.” “Enhance operational resilience.”</p>
<p>Lisa, a principal engineer with eleven years at the company, sits three chairs from the end of the table. She has built or maintained systems that touch nine of the twelve priorities. She knows, with the specificity that comes from reading error logs and tracing database queries, what each of these phrases would require. It is the kind of knowledge that takes a decade to accumulate and thirty seconds to ignore.</p>
<p>“Accelerate digital onboarding” means rewriting a flow that currently passes through six services, two of which are maintained by a team in another country that has a four-week change request cycle. “Improve cross-sell conversion” means surfacing product recommendations inside a transaction flow owned by a different department, whose API has not been updated since 2019. “Enhance operational resilience” means the payments system fell over twice last quarter and nobody has approved the infrastructure work to prevent it happening again.</p>
<p>None of the twelve items specifies a system. None names a team. None defines a measurable outcome beyond a direction: higher, faster, better. The prioritisation is performed by debating which of these phrases matters most, as though ranking aspirations were the same as allocating engineering capacity to concrete changes.</p>
<p>Lisa could map each item to the real constraints. She could say which ones conflict, which ones depend on shared infrastructure nobody wants to fund, and which ones will be quietly abandoned by March. She has done this before, in previous quarters, in different rooms.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire discussion, neither she nor any other engineer is consulted.</p>
<p>The meeting concludes with agreement on the top five. A product manager is assigned to each. Work begins on the roadmap. The roadmap will be presented to Lisa’s teams as commitments. Her teams will estimate against items whose scope is undefined, whose dependencies are unacknowledged, and whose success criteria do not exist.</p>
<p>This sequence of events unfolds on an otherwise ordinary Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a healthy organisation, “the business” functions as the collective set of activities through which value is created, rather than operating as an isolated department.</p>
<p>However, within a software-dependent corporate, this unified definition quietly breaks down.</p>
<p>“The business” becomes a group of people who define intent, set priorities, and claim outcomes, while engineers are positioned as a delivery function that executes those decisions. Product management is inserted as a translation layer. IT or digital is treated as a cost centre. Finance provides the language of truth through lagging indicators.</p>
<p>This separation extends far beyond cosmetic boundaries, forming the absolute root of the underlying pathology.</p>
<p>The moment engineers are excluded from the core definition of “the business,” operational reality is reduced to merely advisory status.</p>
<p>First, strategy becomes detached from execution. Decisions are made in forms that cannot be tested against the system that must realise them. Feasibility is discussed abstractly. Trade-offs are deferred. When reality pushes back, it is framed as resistance rather than feedback.</p>
<p>Second, ownership dissolves. No one owns an outcome end-to-end. Responsibility is distributed across functions that do not share incentives or context. When something works, “the business” claims success. When something fails, engineering is blamed for delivery. The system produces accountability without agency: people are held responsible for outcomes they cannot influence, using criteria they did not define.</p>
<p>It is structurally incapable of producing learning. When success and failure are attributed to the wrong causes, the organisation cannot learn from either. It cannot improve its decisions because it cannot see the connection between decisions and consequences. It can only attribute outcomes to effort, attitude, or luck, none of which are actionable.</p>
<p>Third, coordination replaces autonomy. Since no unit owns a complete slice of value creation, work must be synchronised through meetings, plans, and process. Alignment becomes a full-time job. Progress slows, but activity increases. The organisation begins to confuse the sensation of effort with the evidence of progress. People are busy. The system is slow. Both of these things are true, and neither explains the other.</p>
<p>The phrase “I’m not a techie, I’m in the business” is treated as a joke. It is not. It is a confession. It admits that value is being defined by people who do not and cannot see the system that creates it.</p>
<p>Effective companies avoid this problem entirely by refusing to treat operational reality as a negotiable concept. Engineers work in the business. Strategy discussions include implementation constraints by default. Architecture decisions are business decisions. The org chart does not encode a separation between deciding and doing.</p>
<p>Software-dependent corporates resist this integration because it threatens existing power structures. It collapses the distance between decision and consequence. It forces the people who set direction to understand the system they are directing. For many executives, this feels like a loss of authority.</p>
<p>For a long time, that resistance was survivable. The cost of maintaining the gap fell on those closest to reality, in ways the next chapter examines, and on customers, though less visibly. When an organisation cannot connect intent to execution, customer experience degrades in ways that are difficult to trace. Journeys break at handoff points between teams. Promises made by the commercial side are not honoured by the systems side. Data collected in one process is not available in another. The customer experiences this as unreliability: not dramatic failure, but a persistent, low-level friction that erodes trust. The organisation attributes the friction to “complexity” rather than to a structure that makes coherence impossible.</p>
<p>The cost is real. It compounds. This burden falls heaviest on the people who can least afford it: those holding the system together through knowledge the organisation has never bothered to write down, and skill it has never acknowledged. They are the ones who translate between intent and reality. They are the ones who notice when the strategy and the system disagree. Increasingly, they are the ones who stop speaking up, or leave.</p>

<h2><a href="./#why-people-closest-to-reality-suffer">Chapter 2: Why People Closest to Reality Suffer</a></h2>
<p>It does not happen in a crisis or a confrontation. It is quieter than that.</p>
<p>A principal engineer at an online fashion marketplace raises a concern about a dependency that will block the roadmap. The concern is noted but not addressed. She flags a risk in an architecture review. The risk is acknowledged but deprioritised. She points out that a commitment made to the board cannot be delivered as described. She is told to “find a way.” She suggests an alternative approach that would achieve the goal more reliably. The suggestion is described as “too technical” for the current discussion.</p>
<p>After enough of these exchanges, she stops. Not because she has lost the knowledge. She still sees the problems clearly, still traces the dependencies in her head, still knows which parts of the system are fragile and why. But the cost of stating what she sees has become higher than the cost of staying silent. She learns that the organisation does not want the information she has. It wants compliance wrapped in technical language.</p>
<p>An operations analyst at a logistics company maintains a spreadsheet that nobody asked her to create.</p>
<p>It tracks every exception in the fulfilment process: the customers whose orders require manual intervention, the carrier routes where the standard SLA does not apply, the product categories that need special handling documentation, the warehouses where the inventory system’s count diverges from physical stock by more than the acceptable threshold. The spreadsheet has forty-seven columns. She updates it daily. It is the only accurate record of how the fulfilment process actually works, as opposed to how the system says it works.</p>
<p>When the company decides to replace its order management system, nobody consults her. The requirements are gathered from process owners who describe the process as it is documented, not as it operates. The new system is specified, built, and launched over fourteen months.</p>
<p>Within three weeks of go-live, the same exceptions return. Carriers flag shipments that do not meet special handling requirements. Warehouse staff discover that the inventory reconciliation logic does not account for the discrepancies they have been managing manually for years. Customer service begins receiving complaints about orders that the old system would have routed to manual review but the new system processes automatically, and incorrectly.</p>
<p>She rebuilds the spreadsheet. It takes her two weeks. She adds twelve new columns for exception types that the new system has introduced. Nobody asks where the spreadsheet came from, or why it is necessary, or what it implies about the system that was supposed to replace it.</p>
<p>Her manager praises the new system in a quarterly review. He mentions that the transition was completed on time and under budget. He makes no mention of the spreadsheet, as he remains entirely unaware of its existence.</p>
<p>While the industry and specific roles evolve, the underlying pattern remains remarkably consistent.</p>
<p>In software-dependent corporates, the people who suffer first are not the least capable. They are the most reality-bound.</p>
<p>They are the people whose effectiveness depends on clear ownership, explicit constraints, and contact with how systems actually behave. They notice incoherence early. They see the cost of ambiguity before it shows up in financial results or executive dashboards. They can tell when a plan is not merely optimistic but structurally impossible.</p>
<p>Within a coherent organisation, such a focus serves as a distinct advantage.</p>
<p>However, within a software-dependent corporate, it quickly becomes a severe professional liability.</p>
<p>These organisations do not fail to reward competence because they dislike competence. They fail to reward it because competence collapses options. It reduces the space in which narratives can remain unchallenged. It forces decisions to become specific, which forces responsibility to become local. Such local responsibility is threatening to hierarchies that have learned to operate through diffusion.</p>
<p>Optional reality is comfortable for hierarchies. It allows authority to speak in intent rather than mechanism. It allows strategy to be expressed as aspiration rather than constraint. It allows ownership to be proclaimed without being enforced.</p>
<p>People closest to reality disrupt this comfort by insisting on the medium that hierarchies would rather avoid: the system itself.</p>
<p>The resulting tension is often misdiagnosed as a communication issue. Engineers are told they need to be more commercial, more customer-centric, or more aligned. Product managers are told they need to translate better. “Tech and business alignment” becomes a recurring item on the leadership agenda, addressed through workshops, pairing programmes, and communication skills training that never touch the underlying problem, because the underlying problem is not that people are failing to communicate. It is that reality is being negotiated instead of maintained.</p>
<p>In such an environment, they face a consistent set of punishments. These punishments are rarely made explicit; instead, they are embedded within the organisation’s structure.</p>
<p>They are asked to estimate work whose scope is undefined, against deadlines whose origins are political rather than technical. They are asked to build systems around boundaries that do not exist, to treat slideware as constraints, and to accept accountability for outcomes they cannot influence. They are expected to say “yes” to plans they know will fail, because saying “no” creates friction and honest estimates imply timelines that stakeholders do not want to hear.</p>
<p>If they refuse to conform, they are quickly labelled as difficult.</p>
<p>If they choose to comply, they are forced into an uncomfortable daily hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Neither of these compromises offers a sustainable path forward.</p>
<p>The silence spreads. Other engineers notice who gets rewarded and who gets labelled. The ones who speak in plans and milestones advance. The ones who speak in mechanisms and failure modes are sidelined. The ones who say “we can do this” get promoted. The ones who say “we cannot do this, but we could do that instead” get managed. The organisation selects for fluency in representation and against fluency in reality.</p>
<p>Over time, two populations emerge. Those who have adapted to the representation layer, who have learned to speak in roadmaps, OKRs, alignment language, and strategic narrative, and those who have not. The adapted population rises. The unadapted population leaves, disengages, or is pushed into increasingly narrow technical roles where their reality-orientation cannot disrupt the narrative. Senior engineers become “technical leads” without authority. Architects become diagram maintainers. Staff engineers become firefighters, called upon when the system breaks but excluded from the decisions that caused it to break.</p>
<p>The organisation experiences this as a talent problem. It is not. It is a selection problem. The organisation is systematically filtering out the people it needs most.</p>
<p>When reality is optional, the people who insist on it become inconvenient. When vagueness is rewarded, the people who cannot produce it are disadvantaged. The surrounding system does not actively need to be hostile; it merely needs to maintain a consistent indifference toward structural truth.</p>
<p>Others refuse to adapt, choosing instead to maintain their blunt insistence on reality. They continue to ask where the boundary is, where the process is defined, and who owns the outcome. They keep pointing at the system. They keep refusing to pretend. These people are often labelled as negative, not team players, or lacking in soft skills. They are described as “good technically but poor culturally.” In reality, their behaviour is rational. The system that punishes it is not. Their cultural failure is a refusal to participate in fiction.</p>
<p>Eventually, most of these people leave, disengage, or become absorbed into the illusion machinery. None of these outcomes are good for the organisation. The knowledge that leaves with them is not replaceable through hiring, because the problem is not a shortage of talent. It is an environment that makes talent irrelevant. A brilliant engineer cannot be effective if the system she works within prevents her from seeing reality, naming it, and acting on it.</p>
<p>The organisation hires replacements. The replacements arrive without context, without knowledge of the system’s real behaviour, without understanding of why things were built the way they were. They ask questions. If the organisation still has people who remember the answers, the knowledge transfers slowly and partially. If it does not, if the people who knew have already left, the knowledge is simply lost. The organisation compensates by adding more process, more documentation, more handoffs, more coordination. Each addition increases the distance between the work and the reality it is supposed to address.</p>
<p>The organisation incorrectly perceives a talent problem when it actually suffers from a fundamental inability to confront truth.</p>

<h2><a href="./#activity-without-reality">Chapter 3: Activity Without Reality</a></h2>
<p>A migration originally estimated to require a single sprint ended up consuming eleven weeks.</p>
<p>A B2B SaaS company with 800 employees, roughly 300 of them in engineering, had committed in its annual roadmap to “modernising the platform.” The commitment originated in a strategy offsite. No engineer attended the offsite. The phrase “modernise the platform” appeared on slide nine of a forty-slide deck, beneath a pillar labelled “Operational Excellence.”</p>
<p>By the time the phrase reached the engineering organisation, it had been interpreted as a migration from an on-premise message broker to a managed cloud service. The rationale was never written down in a form that connected it to a customer outcome. When a team lead asked what problem the migration solved for customers, he was told it was “a platform concern” and that the business case had already been approved.</p>
<p>Two teams were assigned. They spent the first three weeks discovering that the existing message broker was entangled with a legacy billing reconciliation service that no one had documented. The reconciliation service used message headers in ways that the cloud service did not support. A third team was pulled in to build an adapter. The adapter required access to a shared schema that a fourth team nominally owned but had not changed in two years.</p>
<p>Eleven weeks later, the migration was complete. Monitoring showed no change in throughput, latency, or error rates. From the customer’s perspective, the experience remained completely unchanged, as the underlying billing reconciliation process operated exactly as before. The total cost, including lost velocity on deferred work, was approximately € 380,000.</p>
<p>The migration was reported as a success. The teams involved were thanked in a town hall. The roadmap for the following quarter listed three more modernisation items.</p>
<p>No one asked whether the original commitment should have been made. No one could, because the commitment had no traceable origin in a customer need or a system constraint. It existed because the roadmap required content, and modernisation is always defensible.</p>
<p>Software-dependent corporates are rarely idle. They are busy in a very specific and highly disciplined way.</p>
<p>Calendars are full. Backlogs are long. Roadmaps extend confidently into the future. Dashboards glow with colour. Meetings conclude with action items, follow-ups, and alignment checkpoints. Documents are produced, reviewed, socialised, revised, and approved. From the outside, these organisations appear intensely productive.</p>
<p>Yet, when a simple question is asked: what exactly changed in the world as a result of all this activity? The answer is often vague, contested, or deferred.</p>
<p>This is the substitution of activity for progress. It is the most pervasive illusion, and the hardest to see from inside.</p>
<p>In an organisation where reality is optional, projecting busyness provides a safe harbour, whereas insisting on precision becomes a professional liability.</p>
<p>When engineers are excluded from the business, work can no longer be grounded directly in the behaviour of the systems that create value. Decisions are made in abstraction, and execution is expected to follow. When it does not, the failure is attributed to delivery rather than to the decision itself. The feedback loop between intent and outcome is severed, and in its absence, the organisation fills the space with motion.</p>
<p>To compensate for this divergence, the organisation naturally begins to invest heavily in representation.</p>
<p>Tickets stand in for changes to systems. Roadmaps imply intent without committing to outcomes. OKRs replace strategy. Status reports replace understanding. Progress is measured by movement inside these artefacts rather than by observable effects on users or operations.</p>
<p>None of these tools are inherently flawed. They become dangerous when treated as reality rather than as hypotheses about reality. Once closing the ticket becomes the goal rather than changing the system, the representation has replaced the thing it was meant to represent. Getting this distinction right is harder than it sounds. I have watched teams I led drift from treating a roadmap as a hypothesis to treating it as a contract, and I did not always notice the moment it happened. The slide from useful map to substitute for reality does not stem from a failure of intelligence, but from the gravitational pull of the organisation’s incentive structures.</p>
<p>A particularly visible manifestation of this pattern frequently appears in how software-dependent corporates attempt to organise their innovation efforts.</p>
<p>Innovation is frequently positioned as something distinct from the organisation’s ordinary operating model. It is given a separate budget, a named executive sponsor, and often a dedicated team operating outside the normal delivery cadence. Governance constraints are relaxed to accelerate progress. External partners are engaged. Architectural standards are temporarily suspended in the name of speed.</p>
<p>The resulting artefacts are often real and technically competent. A new onboarding flow is built. A claims triage engine is rewritten. A pricing model is redesigned. These initiatives are demonstrated successfully, communicated internally as proof of progress, and measured at the point of launch.</p>
<p>What is less visible is how they integrate into the enduring structure of the organisation.</p>
<p>When the initial initiative concludes, the team that built the artefact may not be the team that operates it. The sponsor who authorised it may not be accountable for its long-term behaviour. The process it modifies may still span multiple organisational boundaries that remain structurally unchanged.</p>
<p>In these cases, innovation fails to replace the underlying organisational structure; instead, it is merely layered awkwardly on top. New services are integrated through adapters rather than through redesigned boundaries. Data flows are synchronised rather than reconsolidated. Operational responsibility diffuses. Over time, the estate reflects the history of initiatives more than the logic of processes.</p>
<p>This does not occur because organisations lack creative capacity. It occurs because innovation has been defined as an exception to the system rather than as a natural outcome of process ownership. The separate budget, the suspended governance, the dedicated team: these are not signs of boldness. They are admissions that the ordinary structure cannot change itself. The initiative succeeds precisely because it operates outside the constraints that govern everything else. When it ends, the constraints remain.</p>
<p>As a result, the organisation projects an innovative image, even as its fundamental coordination costs remain completely unchanged.</p>
<p>Over time, the organisation effectively constructs a representative model of itself and begins to inhabit that model instead of reality.</p>
<p>The model is elaborate: plans, priorities, progress reports, roadmaps, OKRs. Planning, prioritisation, and evaluation occur primarily inside this model. The real system evolves underneath it, constrained by physics, dependencies, and accumulated complexity. When the two diverge, and they always diverge, the divergence is not treated as information. It is treated as a failure of execution.</p>
<p>This is why so much effort is devoted to refining representations rather than interrogating reality. Better tickets. More granular estimates. Cleaner roadmaps. Improved OKRs. More frequent ceremonies. The organisation attempts to fix a mapping problem by polishing the map. Each refinement makes the representation more internally consistent while its relationship to reality continues to decay.</p>
<p>For those grounded in the system, this is exhausting. Not because the work is physically demanding, but because it requires sustained participation in a fiction. They know where the real dependencies are. They can tell when a plan is incoherent long before it fails. But this knowledge disrupts the flow of representation, and over time the organisation teaches people which behaviours are safe through a thousand small signals.</p>
<p>People stop saying “this will not work” and start saying “we will need to align.” They stop asking “what does the system actually do” and start asking “what have we committed to.” The organisation talks about delivery, not about behaviour. About velocity, not about outcomes. About alignment, not about truth.</p>
<p>Activity becomes self-sustaining. Work is no longer evaluated by its effect on the world, but by its coherence with other representations of work. Meetings produce action items. Action items produce documents. Documents produce meetings. The loop is closed and self-referential, and if you did not know it was a corporation you might mistake it for a perpetual motion machine. Value leaks out at every handoff, but the loop continues because it generates the sensation of progress.</p>
<p>Many well-intentioned practices quietly invert their purpose here. Planning becomes prediction: the goal shifts from learning to committing, and the plan becomes a contract rather than a hypothesis. Retrospectives become rituals about sentiment rather than investigations into cause, because the causes are structural and addressing them is not within the team’s authority. Agile becomes a vocabulary for negotiating accountability rather than a means of learning. Each practice was designed to increase contact with reality. Each has been adapted to reduce it.</p>
<p>It is the predictable outcome of an organisation that no longer has a single place where truth lives. Rather than being an accidental flaw, this ambiguity serves a specific protective function. The roadmap survives approval precisely because it can be read in multiple ways. The strategy is endorsed precisely because it commits to nothing testable.</p>
<p>The moment representation becomes the accepted unit of progress, actual forward momentum quietly disappears.</p>

<h2><a href="./#architecture-that-avoids-accountability">Chapter 5: Architecture That Avoids Accountability</a></h2>
<p>The architecture review board meets every second Thursday. A team presents a proposal to extract a pricing calculation from a monolith into a dedicated service. The proposal is well-structured. The board evaluates it against a reference model last updated eight months ago. Forty-five minutes are spent debating which bounded context the service belongs in. In the codebase, there are sixty-three services whose boundaries follow a team structure from a reorganisation that predates the reference model by two years. The reference model describes nothing real.</p>
<p>The board grants conditional approval. The team lead nods. She will name the service to match the model, update the Wiki, and build exactly what she originally proposed. The board will ultimately not verify the implementation, as the review process rarely extends to operational reality.</p>
<p>In software-dependent corporates, architecture is often presented as a source of control. Diagrams promise clarity. Reference models suggest foresight. In practice, much of this architectural activity exists to avoid accountability.</p>

<h2><a href="./#microservices-without-autonomy">Chapter 6: Microservices Without Autonomy</a></h2>
<p>The change is straightforward. A logistics company needs to add a new delivery status, “held at customs,” to the tracking flow visible to customers. The status already exists in the customs clearance system. It needs to propagate to the shipment tracking service, which feeds the customer-facing portal.</p>
<p>In a system with real boundaries and owned contracts, this is two days of work. One team adds the status to its published event contract. The consuming team reads the new event and renders it in the portal. Both teams can do this independently, on their own release schedules, with a versioned contract governing the interaction. In practice, however, the actual sequence unfolds very differently.</p>
<p>The shipment tracking service does not own its own data model. It reads from a shared database maintained by a “data platform” team. The data platform team has a change request process that requires approval from three service owners, because any schema modification affects all consumers. The customs clearance system publishes events, but the tracking service does not consume them directly; it waits for the data platform to ingest and transform them.</p>

The team lead has been thorough: a shared drive with architecture diagrams, a Confluence space with process descriptions, a wiki with onboarding guides. There is an operating model document, updated seven months ago, that describes the end-to-end vehicle configuration-to-delivery pipeline in careful detail.</p>
<p>By her third day she has questions. The operating model describes an automated validation step for customer configurations that checks battery options, drivetrain compatibility, and regional compliance before the order enters the manufacturing queue. The system she has been given access to does not contain this step. There is a comment in the code, dated two years ago, that says “validation bypassed pending new battery config rules.” The rules were never written. The automated validation exists in the documentation and in the quarterly metrics report, which lists configuration validation rates as a KPI. It does not exist in production.</p>
<p>She asks the team lead. He is not surprised. “That document describes what we were building towards,” he says. “The system describes what we actually did.” He opens a Slack channel and scrolls to a thread from eighteen months ago. “This is where the real decisions are. Most of them, anyway.”</p>

A schema change needed sign-off from two teams that no longer existed in the organisation chart, routed instead through a governance function that reviewed changes it could not evaluate.

<h2><a href="./#the-first-unit">Chapter 16: The First Unit</a></h2>
<p>The model described in this book does not require wholesale restructuring. It does not require the CEO to dismantle the organisation chart, the CTO to rewrite the architecture, or the board to approve a three-year transformation programme before anything changes. It requires one unit, operating with clarity, governed by a charter that makes autonomy real from day one.</p>
<p>This is not a pilot. A pilot is a temporary experiment, provisionally funded, structurally dependent on the old model for its authority, and designed to be evaluated by the people whose power it threatens. Pilots fail not because the model is wrong but because the organisational immune system has been given an explicit mechanism for rejection: the evaluation gate. The first autonomous unit is a permanent structural change. It operates under its own governance charter, with real authority over its process, its data, its releases, and its priorities. It is evaluated by its outcomes, not by a committee.</p>
<p>One unit, operating with genuine autonomy, creates the selection pressure described earlier in this book. It makes the cost of the surrounding dysfunction visible by contrast. When a single process runs faster, resolves issues in hours rather than weeks, and produces measurable outcomes without coordination theatre, the adjacent teams do not need a strategy deck to understand what has changed. They can see it. The question shifts from “should we restructure?” to “why does everything else still work the old way?”</p>

<p>This chapter describes a year in the life of an organisation that has made the transition. Not a utopia. A realistic picture, with remaining tensions, trade-offs, and difficulties acknowledged. The point is not to promise perfection. It is to show that the problems change in kind, and that the new problems are the kind that capable people can solve.</p>
<p>I have seen versions of this transition. The details are composited and fictionalised, as throughout the book, but the pattern, the initial resistance, the contract that replaced coordination, the incident resolved in minutes rather than days, is drawn from real organisations I have worked inside. Not every transition succeeded fully. Some stalled when political will ran out. Some produced partial results that were still better than the status quo. What follows represents concrete reality rather than mere aspiration; it is exactly what happens when the structural commitment holds.</p>
<p>The transition notably began with a single, bounded unit rather than a sweeping reorganisation. The payments team, seven people at the time, was the first to operate under a governance charter. It was chosen because its process had clear boundaries, measurable outcomes, and a lead who had spent years holding the contradictions between what the organisation said its payments process did and what it actually did. The payments unit’s results over its first six months, resolution times measured in hours rather than weeks, cost per transaction down by a fifth, contract violations detected and resolved without escalation, created the political conditions for the other eleven units to follow. By the time the broader restructuring was announced, the payments unit had already answered the question that every sceptic was asking.</p>

The architect who presents a reference model he knows is fiction, because the alternative is a conversation nobody wants to have. The business analyst translating between three teams who believe they are describing the same process, knowing they are not, knowing she is the only reason anything connects at all. The operations lead who remembers which applications get stuck and why, because no system tracks it, because nobody ever wrote it down.</p>
<p>These individuals are not failing; they are merely coping with a fundamentally broken system. They have been coping for years. The illusions of work described in this book are not organisational stupidity. The narratives that replace reality, the fake products, the avoidant architecture, the processes that were never made explicit: none of these are failures of intelligence. They are how intelligent people remain functional inside a structure that will not let them do real work. The vagueness protects them. The fiction gives them something to point to. The translation layers give them a role. Every illusion serves someone’s need to remain sane.</p>
<p>Now these people are told to use AI and go faster.</p>
<p>The engineer ships more code, against the wrong model, because the right model was never written down. The business analyst produces more documentation, beautifully describing processes that do not exist. The architect generates a target state more polished, more convincing, and more disconnected from reality than anything a human could have produced. Nobody checks, because the outputs look so precise that checking feels unnecessary.</p>
<p>Instead of receiving actual operational relief, the exhausted individual simply receives a faster treadmill.</p>
<p>In this context, AI simply increases the throughput of the coping mechanism rather than reducing the need for it. The organisation produces more confident fiction, faster, at scale. The dysfunction accelerates. It also becomes harder to see, because the AI-generated narrative is so fluent that it suppresses the questions that clumsy human prose used to invite.</p>
<p>This dynamic represents the final stage of the disease made terrifyingly efficient, rather than any genuine transformation.</p>
<p>Here is the cruelest part. These people, the ones being told to go faster, are the only ones who could make AI actually work. They have the domain knowledge. They understand the real system. They know which parts of the architecture diagram are accurate and which are fiction. They know which processes are followed and which are performed for compliance. They could ground AI in reality, supervise it, correct it, direct it. They are the key to everything the organisation says it wants from artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>They are also exhausted, disengaged, or gone. The organisation drove out precisely the people it now needs most.</p>
<p>AI will not say what these people have been saying. Not because the technology cannot surface the contradictions; it can. An AI that reads the codebase alongside the strategy documents will find the gaps in minutes. But surfacing a contradiction is not the same as being heard. These people have been surfacing contradictions for years. They were told they lacked soft skills. They were told they needed to be more strategic. They were told the problem was their attitude, not the structure. If the organisation’s response to honest information has always been to suppress it, rewrite it, or promote around it, then an AI that reads reality is just another voice that gets ignored.</p>
<p>AI cannot be a narrative layered on top. Since it cannot skip the hard part of structural reality, it simply amplifies whatever the organisation inherently already is. If the organisation listens, AI makes listening more powerful. If the organisation avoids, AI makes avoidance more efficient. The fundamental variable determining success is not the tool itself, but the surrounding organisational structure.</p>
<p>The solution to using AI is not an AI strategy. It is addressing the dysfunction the organisation has been refusing to address since the early 2010s.</p>
<p>Rather than introducing an entirely new requirement, artificial intelligence strictly enforces an existing one that was previously violated with impunity. Systems must be understandable. Decisions must be grounded. Boundaries must be explicit. Ownership must be real. Processes must be describable. Strategy must be testable. These were always the conditions for effective organisations. They were just expensive to maintain and easy to fake.</p>
<p>AI makes them cheap to maintain and expensive to fake.</p>
<p>The necessary structural fix is neither radically new nor particularly clever. It is not a framework. It is the thing those coping people have been asking for all along. Make the processes explicit. Give teams real ownership. Let the architecture reflect reality. Stop managing narratives and start managing the actual system. Write reality down precisely enough that a machine can read it, and then let the machine tell you what it finds.</p>
<p>This means autonomous business units that own real processes end to end. Engineers working in the business, not separated from it. Data ownership that follows process ownership. Contracts between units rather than shared databases. Customer journeys and business processes treated as the same thing, expressed precisely enough to constrain the systems that serve them. A straight line from business language into the code, with nothing lost in translation.</p>
<p>These are the structural changes described in the second half of this book. They are available. They have always been available. They are refused because they require redistributing power from the people who control the narrative to the people who understand the system.</p>
<p>Implementing these changes does not demand individual heroism; instead, it requires a collective refusal to sustain the illusion.</p>
<p>Refusal to treat narratives as substitutes for systems. Refusal to accept ownership without authority. Refusal to confuse activity with progress. Refusal to pretend that the next reorganisation, the next framework, the next AI vendor will fix a problem that is structural.</p>
<p>Without ownership, AI merely accelerates whatever structure already exists. If that structure is illusion, the illusion scales.</p>
<p>While AI does not strictly force this refusal, it quickly makes the alternative economically and structurally untenable.</p>
<p>In organisations that make this change, work feels different. Disagreements resolve faster because the artefacts settle what used to require negotiation. Meetings become shorter because the synthesis has already done the reconciliation. Strategy becomes actionable because it constrains behaviour rather than describing aspiration. People closest to reality stop fighting the system and start improving it, because the system is finally structured to reward the habits they have always had.</p>
<p>The problems that remain are genuine: real complexity, real trade-offs, honest uncertainty. Crucially, these new problems are inherently interesting rather than structurally demoralising. They are the reason talented people chose their careers in the first place.</p>
<p>The transition has a human cost. Programme managers, product managers, middle managers whose roles were shaped by the dysfunction will be displaced.</p>
<p>Organisations that continue to rely on illusion will find it increasingly expensive to do so. Talent will drain as capable people discover that organisations structured around reality are more satisfying places to work. AI initiatives will disappoint, not because the technology is immature, but because the organisation cannot describe itself clearly enough to use it. The organisations that refuse will not collapse dramatically. They will simply be outcompeted by those that stopped pretending.</p>
<p>For the engineer who stopped speaking up three years ago because the cost was too high: the economics have changed. The system that penalised your precision now depends on it. The artefacts you always wanted to write are now the artefacts the organisation needs to survive. Your initial insistence on structural precision was not wrong; it was merely ahead of the organisation’s readiness.</p>
<p>If you recognise the pathology but cannot change the structure, if you are not in a position to authorise the transition, the book is still for you. Start where you have ownership. Make your own team’s processes explicit. Write down what your system actually does, not what the slide says it does. Create the artefacts that bind, even if nobody asked for them. When clarity exists in one place, it becomes visible. When it becomes visible, it creates pressure. You may not be able to change the organisation. But you can make the cost of its current structure harder to ignore.</p>
<p>If you are the CTO, or the technology leader who has watched every instrument of clarity get filed away because the board narrative was different and the organisation was not ready to reconcile: you are the sponsor the first unit needs. The synthesis you have carried in your head for years can now be produced by a machine, in hours, against the real system. You do not need the organisation’s permission to start. You need one process, one team, and a charter that makes the boundaries explicit. The evidence will make the case that your arguments never could.</p>
<p>If you are the CEO: ask where truth lives in your organisation. In artefacts that bind, or in meetings that align? Which roles exist to reconcile contradictions the structure refuses to resolve? If an AI read your strategy documents and your production systems side by side, would it find a coherent organisation, or two parallel fictions? If you cannot answer with confidence, you are governing an organisation you cannot see.</p>
<p>If you sit on the board or hold a stake in a software-dependent corporate: the question is not whether the AI investment will be made. It will. The question is whether the organisation can describe itself clearly enough for that investment to produce structural improvement rather than faster narrative. The diagnostic in this book is available before the next funding round, the next board pack, the next due diligence. Use it. If you are a product or design leader who recognised your impossible role in the early chapters: the structure described in the second half of this book does not eliminate your contribution. It makes it possible for the first time. As the role changes, the daily work finally aligns with reality.</p>
<p>A CEO reads a twelve-page synthesis and recognises her own organisation for the first time, without intermediaries, without narrative, without translation. An architect opens a reference model that matches the deployment topology it describes. An engineer says “this will not work,” and the room asks what will.</p>
<p>The correction described here cannot be executed by engineering alone. Without explicit executive authorisation, the organisation will absorb and neutralise the change. If you intend to pursue this path, give Illusions in the Boardroom to your CEO or a board member. This book explains how to dismantle the structure. The companion volume explains why it must be dismantled.</p>
<p>Reality is no longer optional. For the first time in a long while, that is not a burden. It is an advantage.</p>
