  <h1>Chapter 7: Talent Decay as Structural Fragility</h1>

  <p>A principal engineer at a European insurer with approximately five hundred services and a claims management platform that has been accumulating complexity for fifteen years raises a concern about a dependency that will block the roadmap. The concern is noted but not addressed. She flags a risk in an architecture review. The risk is acknowledged but deprioritised. She points out that a commitment made to the board cannot be delivered as described. She is told to find a way.</p>
<p>After enough of these exchanges, she stops. Not because she has lost the knowledge. She still sees the problems clearly, still traces the dependencies in her head, still knows which parts of the system are fragile and why. The cost of stating what she sees has become higher than the cost of staying silent. She stops writing the emails that would have prevented the next incident. The silence is not apathy. It is the rational response to an incentive structure that penalises accuracy.</p>
<p>Two years later, she leaves. The resignation takes ten minutes. The knowledge transfer takes zero, because no mechanism exists for it. She takes with her an understanding of the claims adjudication process, the policy integration constraints, the payment reconciliation edge cases, and the failure modes of the document management service that no document in the organisation captures. Her replacement arrives with equivalent credentials and no context. He spends six months learning what she carried as working knowledge. Some of what she knew, he never learns, because it was never written down.</p>
<p>The organisation describes this as a retention problem, which understates the loss considerably. She describes it differently: she stopped being heard, and then she stopped talking, and then she left. There is a further structural cost: the systematic destruction of the knowledge that makes the organisation legible to itself.</p>
