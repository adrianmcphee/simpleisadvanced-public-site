  <h1>Executive Summary</h1>

  <p>Thesis. Software-dependent corporates evolved structures that separate “the business” from engineering, producing representations with no operational counterpart: narratives that replace reality, portfolio labels with no executable boundary, architecture that advises but does not bind, processes that were never written down. These are not failures of intelligence. They are coping mechanisms whose cost structure has changed. AI makes reconciliation cheap and continuous. The gap between what the organisation says and what the system does becomes measurable. Each quarter of informed inaction extends a record the board will eventually be asked to explain.</p>
<p>Diagnosis. The illusions are structural, not personal. Products exist in portfolios but have no coherent boundary in the code. Architecture describes aspirations rather than systems. Capital attaches to labels while value is created at process boundaries that the financial model cannot observe. Coordination consumes 30–40% of technology delivery headcount. Experienced engineers leave, taking irreplaceable process context. Regulatory exposure compounds silently until the moment it is tested.</p>
<p>Six demands. Before any AI investment, the board should require management to produce six items for a single critical process: (1) a process inventory ranked by revenue contribution and risk exposure, with a named owner for each, (2) a structured process definition with states, transitions, decision points, and failure modes, (3) a single named owner with a charter and boundary, not a committee, (4) a contract inventory listing the units this process depends on, with versioned, testable interfaces, (5) a reconciliation report comparing the definition against the code, and (6) a cost-to-outcome trace connecting investment to operational performance. If management cannot produce these for one critical process within 30 days, every AI investment builds on a foundation the organisation has never inspected.</p>
<p>The choice. AI can write faster narrative or read existing systems. The two paths diverge and the divergence compounds. Each quarter that an organisation operates AI as a narrative tool builds institutional dependence on the output. Switching to the reader path then requires withdrawing confidence from the narrative infrastructure the organisation has spent years constructing. The structural preconditions take years to build and cannot be purchased when the need becomes urgent. The capacity for structural honesty now exists. What remains is whether the people who govern these organisations are willing to act on it.</p>
