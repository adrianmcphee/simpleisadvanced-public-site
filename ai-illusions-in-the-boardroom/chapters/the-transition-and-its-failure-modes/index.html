  <p class="part">Structural Correction</p>
  <h1>Chapter 14: The Transition and Its Failure Modes</h1>

  <p>Each executive role is affected differently by the structural corrections described in the preceding chapters. What follows describes, for each, what stops being governable by narrative, what new artefacts become decisive, what to stop rewarding, and what to authorise. First: the structural shift that applies to all of them, and the transition itself.</p>
<p>Most executives reached their position by operating at distance from mechanism: synthesising across functions, weighing trade-offs, allocating capital without holding every operational detail. This distance is how leadership scales. Over time, it becomes identity.</p>
<p>When processes become explicit and contracts become binding, this pattern changes. Machine-readable artefacts shorten the path between commitment and consequence. The executive who is comfortable experiences it as increased control. The executive who is not experiences it as the loss of interpretive insulation: the capacity to reframe outcomes, diffuse responsibility, and manage contradiction through narrative rather than mechanism. Boards are not always the victims of this resistance. In some organisations, the board is a co-participant: preferring the smoothed narrative because interrogating it would require confronting structural problems the board itself has tolerated.</p>
<p>Quarter one is analytical. A small team maps the three to five core processes that represent the majority of customer value and organisational cost. For a bank: account opening, lending origination, payments, customer servicing. For an insurer: quote-to-bind, underwriting, claims management, renewals. The mapping has two components: the process map itself, what happens, in what order, with what decision points and failure modes, and the overlay, which teams, services, databases, and systems currently participate in each process. The overlay is where the dysfunction is exposed.</p>
