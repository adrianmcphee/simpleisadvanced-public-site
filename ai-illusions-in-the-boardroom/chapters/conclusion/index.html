  <p class="part">Structural Correction</p>
  <h1>Conclusion</h1>

  <p>A board member opens a reconciliation report at 7:40 on a Tuesday morning, twenty minutes before the quarterly review. The report is six pages. It compares the renewals process definition against the code that implements it. She reads that the automated risk reassessment described in the strategy update has not been implemented. The renewals process still routes every modified policy to a manual review queue. The queue is staffed by four people. Average time in queue: eleven days. The strategy update she approved last quarter described the reassessment as “deployed and in optimisation.” She turns to the management narrative prepared for this morning&#x27;s meeting. Page three describes renewals performance as “on track, with automated reassessment reducing processing time by 40%.” She reads the sentence twice. She knows exactly how this sentence was written. She thinks of the four people staffing the manual review queue who already know this.</p>
<p>She sets the management narrative down. For two decades, the reconciliation lived in someone&#x27;s head. In every organisation described in this book, someone carried the real system: she knew which architecture diagrams were fiction, which products did not exist as coherent systems, which processes survived only because she maintained them personally. She kept a private notebook of exceptions that no reporting framework requested, and that notebook, not the strategy deck, not the architecture reference model, not the portfolio taxonomy, was the closest thing the organisation had to a reconciled view of itself.</p>
<p>The notebook is now a reconciliation report. The synthesis she performed socially, at personal cost, across years of accumulated context, is available as infrastructure. It runs against every artefact the organisation produces, continuously, at negligible cost, without political filtering. She has not been replaced. What has changed is that the reconciliation she performed alone and informally can now be performed at organisational scale, which means the question the board faces is no longer whether to trust her judgement but whether to use the infrastructure that makes her judgement visible, or whether to use AI to produce a more polished version of the narrative she spent her career working around.</p>
<p>This book opened with a simple test: if an AI system reads your strategy documents, your architecture models, your process descriptions, and your code together, will the synthesis converge on something coherent, or will it collapse into contradiction? For most software-dependent corporates, the synthesis collapses, and the fifteen chapters between the question and this page have examined why it collapses, what the collapse costs, and what the structural preconditions are for making it converge.</p>
